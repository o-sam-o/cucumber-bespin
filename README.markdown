# Cucumber / Gherkin Syntax Highlighter for Bespin #

## Overview ##
[Bespin](https://bespin.mozillalabs.com/) is an 'cloud' based IDE developed by Mozilla.  A less buzzword definition is a code editor in your web browser.  The Gherkin.js adds syntax highlighting for the Gherkin language which is a "Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that lets you describe softwareâ€™s behaviour without detailing how that behaviour is implemented" used by Cucumber.  Please visit the [Cucumber home page](http://cukes.info/) for more information.
