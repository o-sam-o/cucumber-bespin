<h1>Sample Feature Editor</h1>
<div id="editor" class="bespin" data-bespinoptions='{ "settings": { "tabstop": 4 }, "syntax": "gh", "stealFocus": true }'>Feature: Cucumber syntax highlighter
  In order to view and edit feature files
  developers and BA's
  want a syntax highlighting text editor

  # This is an example of a comment
  Background: Setup stuff
  	Given the following projects:
      |name|description|
      |project 1|project description 1|
   And the following themes:
      |name|description|project|
      |theme 1|theme description|project 1|

  @wip
  Scenario: View a feature
    Given the following features:
      |name|content|theme|
      |feature 1|feature content here|theme 1|
    When I view the feature "feature 1" page
    Then I should see keywords highlighted (e.g. Scenario, Given, When or Then) if they begin a line
    And I should see strings in single (e.g. 'this text') or double (e.g. "this text") quotes highlighted
    And I should see numbers e.g. 1 or 1st highlighted
    But I shouldn't see highlighting when a word contains a single apostrophe
